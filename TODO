Upcoming tasks for consideration/completion, most of which were
suggested during the Feb 2010 pdx.js meeting. Thanks folks!

Not all of these items are TODOs, many are mutually exclusive
possibilites for resolving the underlying problem.

== Better error reporting in _check_options ==

* End use of alert() for reporting errors - modal dialogs are evil
* Collate error messages and report them all at once, rather than
  requiring iterative error discovery
* Display the error messages as text within the div the thermometer
  is being attached to
* Research jQuery UI library for standard error reporting methods
* Check jQuery UI calendar in particular for ideas
* Ignore options that do not make sense and override them with sensible
  defaults instead

== Allow for dynamic segment height ==

* Create a hidden segment, obtain its CSS height attr, then destroy
  the hidden segment (a bit kludgy)
* Make the thermometer's overall height elastic to fill its containing
  element, divide height by number of segments to determine seg_height

== Eliminate need for single/double/triple -digit CSS classes ==

* Make range/limit values sibling elements rather than nested

== Make widget more useful to others by improving generality ==

* Add an optional parameter for defining the right-hand range label
  frequency (e.g, every nth segment)
* Stop requriing parseInt() when passing values to create the widget;
  have the widget handle that (don't forget numeric strings with
  preceding zeros - which can be confused with octal values)
* Give more generic class names to the green/yellow/red segment colors
  to allow applications where different colors may be appropriate.
